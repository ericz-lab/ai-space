# Panel design

The panel is the web entry of an ai-space: a launcher that lists the apps, opens a chat with any agent, shows the widgets apps feed it, and lets the operator add, hide and arrange things. It is served by ai-space itself, on the same loopback port as the Space API, and reads everything it shows from the apps' manifests.

Status: implemented. Service supervision (starting and restarting `service.command`) and skill mounting for agent sessions are not part of this stage; the [app spec](app-spec.md) status table says what is missing.

## Why inside ai-space

The panel started life as a separate process that read a registry of markdown files: one file per app with a name, an icon, a repository, a one-line summary and, for some, a widget endpoint. It worked, and it taught three lessons that shaped this design:

- **The registry drifts from the apps.** A file that lives next to the panel, not next to the app, is edited when someone remembers. Widget endpoints were "hand-written into the registry and lost when the entry was recreated". The app spec already says the manifest is the registration; the panel only had to read it.
- **Private overlays are a workaround for a missing workspace.** Public entries in one directory, private ones in another, tombstones to hide a public entry: all of it existed because the registry was a shared repository. In ai-space the workspace is the operator's own; there is one list.
- **Chat, widgets and layout are Space services.** Spawning a runtime, caching widget payloads, remembering an order: none of it belongs to an app, and a second process next to ai-space would have to duplicate app discovery and the workspace layout.

So the panel is a set of routes in ai-space's `Bun.serve`, a React page bundled from `src/web/` by Bun's HTML import, and two small tables in ai-space's database.

## What the panel shows

| Section | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apps | every registered manifest that has a `url`, with `status` other than `archived`, minus the hidden set; peer apps follow, minus those whose `url` is already listed ([peers.md](peers.md)) | Tile: `icon` and `title`, nothing else on the icon. Click opens `url`. Hover shows the description, the status (health when the app declares `service.health`) and the repository. |
| Agents | `agents:` of every visible app, plus the space agent | Tile shows the avatar and title, with the owning app's icon in the corner when it differs from the avatar; click opens the chat in a floating panel over the page, on that agent. |
| Widgets | `widgets:` of every visible app | `items` cards render the list in the house style; `embed` cards load the app's page in a sandboxed iframe through ai-space. |
| Settings | built in | The last tile of the Apps grid (the Terminal tile sits just before it), not hidden, reordered or uninstalled. It opens a floating panel near the top of the page with the browser preferences (hover details, desk pet, widgets, dark mode, language), the scheduled tasks, the peers and the services. |

| Services (in Settings) | every registered manifest with a `service` | One row per service: icon, title, loopback port, health. |
| Language (in Settings) | the browser's preferences | English or Chinese for everything the panel owns; the browser's language is the default. Apps' titles and descriptions follow when their manifest has an `i18n:` section. Design in [i18n.md](i18n.md). |
| Desk pet (in Settings) | the browser's preferences | A sprite walking along the bottom edge. Off by a switch; any pet from [petdex.dev](https://petdex.dev) by name: the name is looked up in petdex's public manifest, the sheet URL is kept in `localStorage` with the other preferences, and the bundled capybara stands in when the sheet no longer loads. Pets are user-submitted fan art; the browser talks to petdex directly and sends no Referer, which its hotlink protection rejects. |
| Terminal (a built-in tile next to Settings; a floating panel) | this machine, and every peer whose snapshot says `terminal: true` | A machine picker, one tab per session, xterm.js over a WebSocket to a pseudo-terminal running the operator's shell in the workspace root. Off unless the machine sets `SPACE_TERMINAL_ENABLED=1`; every session is opened with a same-origin check and a one-time ticket, optionally a passphrase; sessions close when idle. Design and trust boundary in [terminal.md](terminal.md). |
| Tasks (a floating panel opened from Settings) | every task the scheduler knows, grouped by app | One row per task: status dot, name, effective schedule and event triggers (`on <app>/<event>`, filter and debounce on hover), last outcome and duration, next run, queued events, target kind; `api` and `override` badges; disabled and orphaned tasks muted. A row expands to the last twenty runs with error text and captured output; a run started by hand or carrying events says so. Read-only: it uses the scheduler's `GET /api/tasks` and `GET /api/tasks/:id/runs`, which carry no token; running or toggling a task still goes through the token-guarded routes from the machine. |

Two independent axes decide where an app appears. A `url` means a person can open it: that is a tile. A `service` means a process runs: that is a row under Services. An app with both (a web app) has both; a data or background service with no page has a row and no tile, and stays registered, scheduled and probed, its agents and widgets (if any) in their own sections; a link app has a tile and no row; an app with neither (a repository that only runs tasks) appears in neither, and is still listed by `GET /api/apps?all=1`.

The **space agent** (`space/assistant`, shown as "Base") is the default chat identity: a session in the workspace root with a short built-in prompt. Its model menu groups the configured chat runtimes (including Claude Code and Codex) into basic, junior, intermediate and advanced tiers, using the mappings in `runtimes.yaml`. The selection is remembered in the browser and captured for each message when it is queued, so later control changes cannot reroute an already queued turn. Switching runtimes starts a new conversation; history restores the original runtime and model. Base uses full native context, tools and skills; the permission menu independently controls execution access. It is the one exception to "nothing exists outside an app", on the same footing as the Space services themselves.

## Manifest-only apps

The launcher must be able to show things that are not ai-space services: a page, a tool on another machine, a repository. Rather than a second kind of entry, these are ordinary apps whose directory holds only a manifest:

```
<workspace>/apps/docs/
└── space.yaml       spec, name, title, description, icon, url
```

ai-space treats them like any app (they can even declare widgets with a full `source` URL, or agents). The panel creates them when the operator adds a link, and uninstalling one just removes the directory. A manifest-only directory is not a git repository; it is restored from a workspace backup, not from a clone.

## Adding an app from a link

Edit mode has an "Add" tile that takes one link. The panel asks the claude runtime to read the page (`claude -p … --allowedTools WebFetch`) and answer with a JSON object of identity fields, validates the answer, writes `apps/<name>/space.yaml`, and syncs the new directory (storage, scheduler, registry) like a boot would. The link itself becomes `url` when the answer names none. Fields can also be posted directly, which is what a script or a skill does.

## Arranging, hiding and uninstalling apps

Everything the operator does to the launcher happens in **edit mode**: long-press (or press and hold the mouse) on the panel background until the tiles start to jiggle; a click on the background leaves it. Edit mode offers four things, none of which need the API token because they come from the browser:

- **Move.** Drag a tile to a new place in its group; the order is saved when the tile is dropped (`PUT /api/panel/layout`). Apps, agents and widgets are ordered separately. A peer's entries are ordered on the hub by their prefixed id (`<peer>/<app>`), so moving them never touches the peer.
- **Hide.** The ✕ on a tile hides the app on this panel (`PATCH /api/apps/:app { hidden: true }`): its tile, agents and widgets disappear, the app itself keeps running and stays in the workspace. `?all=1` on `GET /api/apps` lists hidden apps, and the same route with `hidden: false` brings one back. For a peer's app the ✕ hides it on the hub only (`PATCH /api/peers/:peer/apps/:app`).
- **Resize a widget.** In edit mode every widget card has a grip in its bottom-right corner; dragging it snaps the card to 1 or 2 columns and 1 or 2 rows (the head shows the size while dragging). The size is stored on release in the layout (`PUT /api/panel/layout { sizes: { "<app>/<widget>": "1x2" } }`) and overrides the manifest's `size` on this panel; `null` returns the widget to the manifest's size. The app's repository is not touched.
- **Add.** The "Add" tile takes a link; see the previous section.
- **Uninstall.** Below the app grid, edit mode shows an uninstall zone. Dropping a tile there opens a confirmation that says what will happen, then sends `DELETE /api/apps/:app` (for a peer's app `DELETE /api/peers/:peer/apps/:app`, which the hub forwards to the peer and then refreshes its snapshot). In order:
  1. A task of the app with a run in flight refuses the uninstall with 409 and names the tasks: stopping the service and moving the directory would pull the ground from under that run. `DELETE /api/apps/:app?force=1` (`space app uninstall APP --force`) goes ahead anyway.
  2. The service is stopped with the operator's stop command (`SPACE_SERVICE_STOP` in the workspace `.env`, `{app}` replaced by the name, e.g. `sudo systemctl disable --now {app}`). A stop that fails aborts the whole uninstall with 502 and the app stays as it was. With no stop command configured the service is left running and the response says `stopped: "unconfigured"`.
  3. The directory leaves the workspace without losing code: a symlink is unlinked and its target left alone, a checkout under `apps/` is moved to `<workspace>/trash/<name>-<stamp>`, a manifest-only directory is deleted, a directory registered through `SPACE_APPS` is left where it is (`dir.kind` in the response: `unlinked`, `moved`, `deleted`, `kept`).
  4. The app is forgotten: its manifest tasks become orphaned (run history kept), its agents and widgets leave the panel, its service leaves the list. The data directory `<workspace>/data/<name>/` is kept; the response names it.

  Uninstalling does not touch the app's repository, its systemd unit file, its tunnel hostname or its data. Those are the operator's, and the [app spec](app-spec.md#lifecycle) lists them under retiring an app. Removing the directory by hand and calling `POST /api/apps/sync` has the same effect on the space, minus the stop command; the sync reports such apps under `gone`.

## Layout and state

Two tables in `space.db`, both panel-owned:

- `panel_kv` holds the layout: `{ order: { apps, agents, widgets }, hidden, sizes }`. Order lists are ids: app names, `app/name` for agents and widgets, and `<peer>/…` for entries from a peer machine; ids missing from a list follow it, local before peer, alphabetically. `hidden` is the set of apps the panel does not show; they stay registered and scheduled. `sizes` maps widget ids to the size the operator chose on the panel, applied over the manifest's `size` when widgets are listed.
- `chat_sessions` keeps the last ten sessions per agent (`agent`, `sid`, `title`, `ts`, `runtime`, `model`). A resumed session gets a new id from the runtime; the previous row is replaced so a conversation stays one entry.

Nothing panel-related is written into an app directory or into the workspace as loose files.

## Chat

`POST /api/agents/:app/:agent/chat` runs one turn: ai-space spawns `claude -p <message> --output-format stream-json` in the agent's working directory with the identity from the manifest (`--append-system-prompt` from the prompt file plus the app title, description and `AGENTS.md`; `--allowedTools` from `tools`; `--model` from the request, the manifest, then `SPACE_CHAT_MODEL`) and streams the events back as server-sent events. Multi-turn continuity is `--resume <sid>`. The browser can pick a write tier (`acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`); the default is the headless read-only behaviour. `SPACE_CHAT_ARGS` appends operator-chosen arguments to every run.

Transcripts are read back from the runtime's own store (Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/<sid>.jsonl`; Codex: `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/**/rollout-*-<sid>.jsonl`; DeepSeek Harness: its session log), so restoring a past session costs no extra storage. Base accepts a `runtime/tier` or `runtime/model` in the request's `model` field. A resumed session stays on its recorded runtime; changing runtimes requires a new conversation. Other agents run on the runtime their manifest names ([runtimes.md](runtimes.md)); an agent naming a runtime the space lacks, or one without chat, answers 501. The browser reads Claude Code's `stream-json` events; another runtime's adapter translates its own events into that shape.

## Widgets

`GET /api/widgets` fetches every `kind: items` source through ai-space, caches each payload for the widget's `refresh`, and returns at most twenty items with only the contract fields (`text`, `url`, `time`). A failing source yields `{ ok: false, error }` and the card shows the error as is. Sources are resolved server-side: a path is joined to `http://127.0.0.1:<service.port>`, a full URL is used unchanged; neither reaches the browser. `kind: embed` widgets are proxied at `GET /api/widgets/:app/:name/embed?theme=&lang=` because the browser cannot reach loopback (both parameters are forwarded to the page, `lang` only when it is a language tag); the page must be self-contained (inline assets or absolute public URLs).

## Events

The settings open an Events window next to Tasks and Model usage: the bus's catalogue (what every app, local or on a peer, provides, publishes and consumes, with call counts) and the last hundred events, each opening to its http and stream deliveries with status, attempts and last error ([events.md](events.md)). Read-only, like Tasks.

## Health

Service supervision is not implemented yet, so the panel probes `GET 127.0.0.1:<port><service.health>` (two-second timeout), caches the result for fifteen seconds, and shows a green or red dot. Apps without `service.health` show no dot.

`GET /api/apps` never waits for a probe: it answers with the cached result, or `unknown` for a service not probed yet, and starts the probe behind the answer, so a service that is down or slow cannot hold the tiles back. The page asks for the list once more a moment later when any dot came back `unknown`. `GET /api/services` (the Settings list) waits for the probes.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` and the PWA files | the web UI |
| `GET /api/apps`, `GET /api/apps/:app` | app views (`?all=1` lists every app, including hidden ones and those without a url) |
| `GET /api/services` | every app with a `service`: port and health, for Settings; plus `peers`, one entry per peer machine |
| `POST /api/apps` | create a manifest-only app from `{ link }` or identity fields |
| `PATCH /api/apps/:app` | `{ hidden }` |
| `DELETE /api/apps/:app[?force=1]` | uninstall: stop the service, take the directory out of the workspace, forget the app (see above); 409 while a task of the app is running, unless forced |
| `GET /api/apps/:app/icon`, `GET /api/agents/:app/:agent/avatar` | icon files from the app directory; paths cannot escape it |
| `GET /api/widgets`, `GET /api/widgets/:app/:name/embed` | widget payloads and embed pages |
| `GET`/`PUT /api/panel/layout` | order and hidden set |
| `GET /api/panel/appcolor?app=` | the app page's `theme-color`, for the phone shell |
| `GET /api/agents` | every agent the panel lists |
| `POST /api/agents/:app/:agent/chat` | one chat turn, SSE |
| `GET /api/agents/:app/:agent/sessions[/:sid]` | recent sessions, restored transcript |
| `GET /api/peers`, `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/peers/:peer/apps/:app`, `/api/peers/:peer/…` | peer machines, hub-side hide, forwarded uninstall/icon/embed/chat/sessions ([peers.md](peers.md)) |
| `GET /api/terminal`, `POST /api/terminal/sessions`, `DELETE /api/terminal/sessions/:id`, `GET /api/terminal/ws`, `/api/peers/:peer/terminal/…` | the web terminal: status and machines, open a session (one-time ticket), end one, the session socket; the same on a peer, forwarded and bridged ([terminal.md](terminal.md)) |
| `/api/peer/…` | this space as a peer of a hub, bearer-guarded ([peers.md](peers.md)) |

## Trust boundary

These routes carry no bearer token. The browser cannot hold `SPACE_API_TOKEN`, and the panel is reached the way the previous panel was: through the operator's tunnel and access layer from outside, through loopback on the machine. The machine-side routes (tasks, storage, notify) keep the token. Consequences to be aware of:

- Anyone who passes the access layer can open a chat with `bypassPermissions`, which is a shell on the machine with the operator's runtime login. This is the same exposure as before, now written down.
- Anything on the machine that can reach loopback can add an app from a link, uninstall an app (which runs the stop command) and change the layout. Command tasks run as the same user anyway.

- The terminal, when a machine enables it, is the same shell without the agent in between. It adds what the other routes lack because a cross-site page could otherwise open it through the operator's browser: a same-origin check on every request that opens or ends a session, a one-time ticket on the socket, an optional passphrase, an idle limit and a cap. [terminal.md](terminal.md#trust-boundary) states the whole boundary.

An operator who wants a second factor puts it in front of the tunnel, not in ai-space.

## Module layout

```
src/space/panel/    registry.ts (registered manifests), layout.ts (panel_kv), health.ts,
                    widgets.ts (feed + cache), view.ts (API shapes), links.ts (manifest-only apps), uninstall.ts (stop + directory),
                    api.ts (routes)
src/space/peers/    other machines' panels merged into this one, and this one served to a hub (peers.md)
src/space/terminal/ the web terminal: PTY backends, tickets and sessions, audit rows, routes and the socket bridge to a peer (terminal.md)
src/space/agents/   runtime.ts (claude process + SSE), sessions.ts (chat_sessions),
                    transcript.ts, api.ts (routes, space agent)
src/web/            index.html, main.tsx (language root), App.tsx, Chat.tsx, Tasks.tsx, Terminal.tsx, Pet.tsx, petdex.ts (pet lookup),
                    i18n.ts (dictionaries, language choice), styles.css, api.ts, routes.ts (HTML import + public files),
                    public/ (PWA shell, pet sprite)
```

`bun run dev` starts ai-space with `SPACE_DEV=1`, which turns on Bun's dev server for the page (hot reload); the default is one bundle at boot.

## Migrating from a registry-based panel

1. For every app that already is an ai-space app, fill in the identity fields (`title`, `description`, `icon`, `url`) and, where the registry had one, the `widgets` entry.
2. For every other registry entry, create `apps/<name>/space.yaml` with the identity fields and copy its icon file next to it as `icon.svg`. When that app later moves into the workspace, the directory is replaced by the clone.
3. Registry agents move into the `agents:` section of the app they belong to, their prompt into `agents/<name>.md`; the generic default agent is the space agent and needs no entry.
4. Import the old order into the layout: `PUT /api/panel/layout` with the names in order.
5. Point the tunnel at ai-space's port and stop the old panel; keep it installed until the new one has been used for a while.

## Failure modes considered

- A manifest fails validation: the app is skipped with a log line and the panel does not list it, same as the scheduler. Nothing partial.
- A widget source is slow or down: eight-second timeout, error shown on the card, next attempt after `refresh`.
- The runtime is missing or exits non-zero: the SSE stream ends with an `error` event carrying the last lines of stderr, then `done`.
- The browser disconnects mid-turn: the response stream is cancelled and the runtime process is killed.
- Two people reorder at once: last write wins; the layout is small enough that this is acceptable.
- An icon path points outside the app directory: 404.
